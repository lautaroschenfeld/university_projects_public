We developed this practical assignment in C#, during the first quarter of the course, in 2023. We covered the fundamental topics of programming: sequential, conditional, and iterative structures, which encompass all the steps to solve a problem, getting ready to start learning to make GUIs. As an extra touch, I took the opportunity to add some coloring and formatting to make the output in the console look nicer.

The program was a manager for gatekeepers, allowing them to charge individual or group tickets, display purchase tickets, and automatically handle multiple restrictions in the case of group tickets. Additionally, it offered the ability to keep track of the cash register and provide a summary of the people who entered the Circuit.
