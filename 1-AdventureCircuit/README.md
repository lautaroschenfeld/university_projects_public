We developed this practical assignment in C#, during the first quarter of the course, in 2023. We covered the fundamental topics of programming: sequential, conditional, and iterative structures, which encompass all the steps to solve a problem, getting ready to start learning to make GUIs. As an extra touch, I took the opportunity to add saome coloring and formatting to make the output in the console look nicer.
